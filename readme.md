## Lumen PHP Framework - TCP-based Protocol ( Async Lumen framework)
- This work is in its early phase. It's now just a fork from Lumen framework. This might be changed later.
- Lumen is a popular php microframework ( based on laravel,symfony and others).
- The goals are:
    - To replace http protcol with any custom TCP protocol without changing anything inside Lumen framework.
    - To Use embeded async server just like express.js and node.js
- [ReactPHP](https://github.com/reactphp/socket) is used for async tcp requests.

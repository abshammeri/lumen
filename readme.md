# Lumen PHP Framework - TCP-based Protocol ( Async Lumen framework)
- This work is in its early phase. It's now a fork from Lumen framework.
- Lumen is a popular php microframework ( based on laravel,symfony and others).
- The goals are:
    - to replace http protcol with any custom TCP protocol without changing anything inside Lumen framework.
    - Use embeded async server just like express/node.js
